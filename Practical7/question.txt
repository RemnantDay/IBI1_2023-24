My question is: How has the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK changed over time, more similar or less similar?
It is addressed from line 38 to line 49 in the code.
Result and discussion: From the plot we can see that the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK are more similar, because the lines are closer in the plot. It shows a more similar trend.
